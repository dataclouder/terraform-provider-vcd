# vcd\_multisite\_org\_association

Provides a resource to create, read, and modify a VMware Cloud Director org association.


Supported in provider *v3.13+*

## Example Usage 1

Creating an org association using an association data file.

To create an association in the current org (`org1`), we need a file containing the other org (`org2`) information, which its
administrator will have created using the data source `vcd_multisite_org_data`.

```hcl
data "vcd_org" "my-org" {
  name = "my-org"
}

resource "vcd_multisite_org_association" "org1-org2" {
  org_id                = data.vcd_org.my-org.id
  association_data_file = "org2.xml"
}
```

## Example Usage 2

Creating an org association using association data from some other source.

```hcl
resource "vcd_multisite_org_association" "org1-org2" {
  org_id           = data.vcd_org.my-org.id
  association_data = var.remote_data
}
```
Here, `var.remote_data` contains the same XML that was generated by `vcd_multisite_org_data` in the other org.
Use this method if it is more convenient than reading XML from a file.

## Argument Reference

* `org_id` - (Required) The ID of the current organization where we start the association with a remote one.
* `association_data_file` - (Optional, but required if `associated_data` is not used) Name of the file containing the data used to associate to this org from another one.
  (Used instead of `associated_data`). This file can be created (by the other org administrator) using the data source `vcd_multisite_org_data`.
* `association_data` - (Optional, but required if `associated_data_file` is not used) Data produced from another org, needed to associate to this org from another one.
  (Used instead of `associated_data_file`)

## Attribute Reference

* `associated_site_id` - ID of the remote site to which the associated org belongs.
* `associated_org_id` - ID of the remote org associated with the current one.
* `associated_org_name` - The name of the associated org.
* `status` - The status of the association (one of `ASYMMETRIC`, `ACTIVE`, `UNREACHABLE`, `ERROR`)
